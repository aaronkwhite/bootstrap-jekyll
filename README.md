# Jekyll-Bootstrap

A Bare Bones Jekyll & Bootstrap site starting point that doesn't assume anything.

### Version
Current - 1.1.0

## About
This repo was created as a starting point to use Jekyll & Bootstrap to create static websites. Most Jekyll & Bootstrap scaffolds assume too much, spend less time undoing configurations geared towards building a blog and start building sites faster.

### Get Started
Clone the repo and start building your site:

```
 git clone git@github.com:aaronkwhite/bootstrap-jekyll.git project-name
```

The core components are located in the *source* directory, so you can better oranize your content and stucture.

This repo is uing Bootstrap LESS & Font-Awesome LESS, located in the root directory. You'll need to setup compass or use Codekit to compile the LESS into the `source/assets/stylesheets` directory.

To test your site locally just run:

```
jekyll serve
```

*Note:* Make sure you update your git remote before you try to push any changes.

### Dependencies
 - Jekyll
 - Bootstrap (current version 3.2.0)
 - LESS Compiler
