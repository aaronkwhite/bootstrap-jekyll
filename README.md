A Bare Bones Jekyll & Bootstrap site starting point.

### Version
Current - 0.0.1

Bootstrap - v3.2.0

### About
This repo was created as a starting point to use Jekyll & Bootstrap to create static websites. More and more I need to create websites and not just blogs, so why not share this with the world.

### Usage
Clone the repo and start building your site. The core components are located in the *source* directory, so you can better oranize your content and stucture.

This repo is uing Bootstrap LESS, located in the root directory. Currently I'm manually compiling all less files to `source/assets/...` using Codekit.
